# Week-Data-Visualization
This mini data visualization project was built using Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook to reinforce my understanding of basic plotting concepts.  I visualized a fictional dataset representing how I spent my week — study time, screen time, and sleep hours — using various types of plots like bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and subplots.
